                       Towering facades and flowing architecture are leaves taken from the aesthetics of the Cholas,
                        an ancient dynasty that made a deep impact on many regions within and outside of this country.
                         From the shores of the Bay of Bengal to that of South Asian borders of Malaysia, China 
                         and Sri Lanka among others, the Cholas have influenced art, architecture and culture from
                          their time to now.
